\subsection{Note in Theorem 13.6}

Theorem~13.6
considers \(S^2\) to be the complex plane and $K$ a compact subset.
Before the proof the text notes
that \(S^2 \setminus K\) has at most countably many components.

This can be shown by noting that \(G = S^2 \setminus K\)
is open, and for any \(z\in G\) there is an open neighborhood
\(V = \{\zeta\in \C: |\zeta - z|<\epsilon\}\)
for some \(\epsilon > 0\) and 
such that \(z \in V \subset G\). Clearly $V$ is connected
so it is a subset of a connected component of $G$.

Also, $V$ must contain
some point of the form \(x + iy\) where \(x,y\in\Q\).
Now since \(\C_{\Q} =\{x + iy: x,y\in\Q\}\) is a countable set,
there could not be more components than \(|\C_{\Q}|\).
