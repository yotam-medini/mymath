\chapterTypeout{About this Document}

Here I try to solve problems
from the book \cite{RudinFA79}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Functional Analysis}\\
by
\textbf{Walter Rudin}
\end{center}

The publisher  McGraw-Hill has the following:
\begin{center}
\texttt{http://catalogs.mhhe.com/mhhe/viewProductDetails.do?isbn=0070542368}
\end{center}
web-page for this book.


\begin{center}
Whenever there is reference to theorem or lemma, it implicitly
targets this text, unless otherwise specified.
Furthermore, we have in this document lemmas or theorems
which are referred to as \emph{local} lemma
or \emph{local} theorem.
\end{center}
