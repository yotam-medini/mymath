\subsection{Proof of Theorem 12.4}

% \newcommand{\inprod}[2]{\ensuremath{\langle #1, #2 \rangle}}

The proof of Theorem~12.4 says that \(E^\perp\) is closed by the
Schwartz inequality of Theorem~12.2. Here is the justification.

Let \(x_n \xrightarrow{n\to \infty} x\) and \(x_n \in E^\perp\).

Pick \(\epsilon > 0\). Let \(N<\infty\) such that
\(\forall n>N \quad \|x-x_n\| < \epsilon/\|y\|\).
Now
\begin{equation*}
|\lrangle{x, y}| = |\lrangle{x-x_n, y} + \lrangle{x_n, y}| =
  |\lrangle{x-x_n, y}| 
 \leq \|x - x_n\|\cdot \|y\| \leq (\epsilon/\|y\|)\|y\| = \epsilon.
\end{equation*}
Since \(\epsilon\) is arbitrary \(\lrangle{x,y} = 0\) and \(E^\perp\) is closed.

Throughout these exercises, the letter $H$ denotes a Hillbert space.

%%%%%%% 1
\begin{excopy}
The completion of an inner product space is a Hilbert space.
Make this statement more precise, and prove it.
(See the proof of Theorem 12.40 for an application.)
\end{excopy}

Let $G$ be an inner product space.
Let $S$ be the set of all Cauchy sequences in $G$.
Define an equivalence relation on $S$.
Denote \(s_k = (s_{k,j})_{j\in\N}\) for \(k=1,2\)
where  \((s_1 \simeq s_2\) (in $S$)
if \((t_j)_{j\in\N}\) defined by \(t_j = s_{1,j}-s_{2,j}\)
is a Cauchy sequence (clearly) converging to \(0\in G\).
Let \(H = S/\simeq\). We identify \(T: G\to H\) by
\(T(g)=(x_j)_{j\in\N}\)  where \(\forall j\in\N\, x_j=g\).
Define 
\begin{equation*}
\lrangle{s_1,s_2} = \lim_{j\to\infty} \lrangle{s_{1,j},s_{2,j}}.
\end{equation*}
By Theorem~12.2 that does not use completeness, it is clear
that the deinition is independent of representatives.

%%%%%%% 2
\begin{excopy}
Suppose $N$ is a positive integer,
\(\alpha \in \C\), \(\alpha^N = 1\), and \(\alpha^2 \neq 1\).
Prove that every
Hilbert space inner product satisfies the identities
\begin{equation*}
 (x, y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \|x + \alpha^n y\|^2 \alpha^n
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
 (x, y) = \frac{1}{a\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi \|x + e^{i\theta} y\|^2 e^{i\theta}\,d\theta.
\end{equation*}

Generalize this: Which functions $f$ and
measures \(\mu\) on a set \(\Omega\) give rise to the
identity
\begin{equation*}
 (x, y) = int_\Omega \|x + f(p)y\|^2 \,d\mu(p) \,\textnormal{?}
\end{equation*}

\end{excopy}

Let \(A = \{\alpha^j: 0\leq j < N\) and
\(\alpha\cdot A = \{\alpha x: x\in A\}\) and \(S=\sum_{x\in A} x\).
Clearly \(\alpha \cdot A = A\).
Thus \(\alpha S = S\) and so \(S=0\) since \(\alpha \neq 1\).

Let \(S_2 = \sum_{0\leq j<N} \alpha^{2j}\).
If $N$ is odd then \(\{x^2: x\in A\} = A\) and so \(S_2 = 0\).
If $N$ is even put \(\alpha S_2 = \sum_{0\leq j<N} \alpha\cdot\alpha^{2j}\).
Thus \((1+\alpha)S_2 = 2A = 0\). Since \(\alpha \neq -1\) we have \(S_2=0\).

Now
\iffalse
\begin{align*}
 \|x + \alpha^n y\|^2
   &= \|x\|^2 + \lrangle{x, \alpha^n y} + \lrangle{\alpha^n y, x} + \|y\|^2 \\
   &= \|x\|^2 + \overline{\alpha^n}\lrangle{x, y}
             + \alpha^n\overline{\lrangle{x, y}} + \|y\|^2. \\
   &= \|x\|^2 + 2\Re\left(\alpha^{-n}\lrangle{x, y}\right) + \|y\|^2.
\end{align*}
\fi
\begin{equation*}
 \|x + \alpha^n y\|^2
   = \|x\|^2 + \lrangle{x, \alpha^n y} + \lrangle{\alpha^n y, x} + \|y\|^2
   = \|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2 + \alpha^{-n}\lrangle{x, y} + \alpha^n \lrangle{y, x} 
\end{equation*}

Now
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha^n \cdot \|x + \alpha^n y\|^2 
 &= N\left(S(\|x\|^2 + \|y\|^2)
    + \alpha^{-n+n}\lrangle{x, y} + \alpha^{2n} \lrangle{y, x}\right) \\
 &= N\left( 1\cdot \lrangle{x, y} + S_2\lrangle{y, x}\right)
    = N\cdot \lrangle{x, y}.
\end{align*}
This proves the first desired equality.
