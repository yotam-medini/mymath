Here I try to solve problems
from the book \cite{kunen2011set}

Whenever there is reference to theorem or lemma, it implicitly
targets this text, unless otherwise specified.
Furthermore, we have in this document lemmas or theorems
which are referred to as \emph{local} lemma
or \emph{local} theorem.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
In proof of lemma I.9.36\\
\(\{y \in T: {\rm mos}(a) \neq a\}\)

should it be:\\
\(\{y \in T: {\rm mos}(y) \neq y\}\).
