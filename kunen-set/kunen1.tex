\begin{manuallemma}{I.7.8}
\(ON\) is a transitive class. That is, if \(\alpha \in ON\)
and \(z \in \alpha\),
then \(z \in ON\).
\end{manuallemma}
The proof says ``it is easy to check that $z$ is a transitive set.''
\\
Here is how. Let \(y \in z\), we need to show \(y \subseteq z\).
By transitivity, \(z \subseteq \alpha\) and so \(y \in \alpha\).
Again by transitivity, \(y \subseteq \alpha\).
Let \(x\in y\), thus \(x \in \alpha\) and actually \(x,y,z \in \alpha\).
By orering of \(\alpha\), we have \(x\in y \in z\) and hence \(x\in z\)
giving the desired \(y \subseteq z\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.4.18}{24}
Derive \(\forall y[y \notin y]\) from the Axioms of Comprehension and
Foundation. Don't use the Pairing or Extensionality Axioms. Then find a
two element model for Foundation, Extensionality, Pairing, and Union, plus
\(\exists y\forall x [x \in y]\) (so, of course, \(y \in y\)).
\end{lexcopy}

By negation \(y\in y\).
By Comprehension, let \(\varphi(z)\) be \(z=y\). Apply
\begin{equation*}
  \exists x \forall z (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z))
\end{equation*}
gives \(x:=\{y\}\). By Foundation, $y$ being the (only) minimal
element for which
\mbox{\(\lnot\exists z(z\in y \wedge z \in \{y\})\)}
should hold, but \(z=y\) gives contradiction.

Let the model have two ``sets'': \(\mu\), \(\nu\).
with the following ``\(\in\)'' relations:
\(\mu\in\nu\), \(\nu\in\nu\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.23}{31}
Define the relation $R$ on \(\N \times \N\) by saying: \((x_0,x_1)R(y_0,y_1)\)
iff \(x_0 \leq y_0\) and \(x_1 \leq y_1\)
and \((x_0,x_1)\neq (y_0,y_1)\).
Show that $R$ is well-founded
on \N\ but not a total order.
Show that every non-empty \(X \subseteq \N\times\N\) contains
only finitely many $R$-minimal elements, and, for each \(k \in\N\),
there is such an
$X$ with exactly $k$ $R$-minimal elements.
\end{lexcopy}

Let non-empty \(A \subset \N\times\N\).
Let \(P = \{n\in\N: \exists m((n,m)\in A\).
For each \(n\in P\) let \(Q_n = \{m\in\N: (n,m)\in A\}\).
Let \(p = \min(P)\) and \(q = \min(Q_p)\).
Clearly \((p,q)\in A\) is minimal in $A$.

Not total order since
\((0,1)\not{R}(1,0)\) and
\((1,0)\not{R}(0,1)\).

Given $k$, \(A=\{(n,k-n-1)\in\N\times\N: 0\leq n < k\}\)
has $k$ elements all of which are minimal.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.26}{31}
Show that \(\in\) is a well-order of $3$.
\end{lexcopy}

The set 
\(3 = \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}, \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}\).
has $3$ elements. Clearly for any two elements \(x,y\in 3\)
we have \(x=y \lor (x\in y \lor y \in x)\).
and any non empty subset has a minimal element.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.29}{33}
Show that the Axiom of Foundation implies that the successor
function $S$ is $1-1$ on $V$.
\end{lexcopy}
Assume \(x \neq y\). % , \wlogy\ \(b\in x \setminus y\).
If by negation \(S(x) = S(y)\), then % \(b = \{y\}\).
\(x \in S(y)\) and so \(x\in y\).
Similarly \(y \in x\). Thus \(\{x, y\}\) has no ``\(\in\)-minimal''
element contradiction to to the Axiom of Foundation.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.2}{34}
Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, show that every 
nonempty transitive set contains $0$ and show that every non-singleton
transitive
set contains $1$. Then show that $1$ is the only one-element transitive set,
and $2$
is the only two-element transitive set.
\end{lexcopy}

Let \(T\neq\emptyset\) be transitive set.
By Axiom of Foundation there is an
element \(e\in T\) if by negation \(x\in e\),
by transitivity \(x\in T\) contradicting the existance of $e$,
thus \(e = \emptyset \in T\).
Clearly \(1= \{\emptyset\}\) is the only singleton transitive set.

If $T$ is non-singleton, let \(S = T \setminus \{\emptyset\} \neq \emptyset\).
Since $S$ is not transitive, let \(u \in S\)
be such that \(u \not\subseteq S\).
Since \(u\subseteq T\), we have \(\emptyset \in u\)
that is \(1 = \{\emptyset\} \in u\).

If $T$ is two element set,
then \(S = T \setminus \{\emptyset\}=\{u\}\) is a singleton.
Also \(u \subset T = \{\emptyset, u\}\).
But \(u \neq \{\emptyset\}\),
so $u$ must be singleton conisting of some element of $T$.
Since \(u\notin u\) its element must be \(\emptyset\),
namely \(u = \{\emptyset\}\) and
\(T = \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\} = 2\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.25}{38}
  Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, $z$ is an ordinal iff $z$ is
  a transitive set and \(\in\) satisfies trichotomy on $z$.
\end{lexcopy}

If $z$ is an ordinal, then by definition it is transitive
and since  \(\in\) is an order, it satisfies trichotomy.

Conversely, assume that  $z$ is  a transitive set
and \(\in\) is trichotomy on $z$.
Let \(S\subseteq z\) be some non-empty set. By Axiom of Foundation,
we have \(y \in S\) such that \(\forall z\in y (z\notin S)\).
If by negation $y$ uis not \(\in\)-minimal in $S$,
then \(\exists m\in s(m\in y)\) is a contradiction.
Ths \(\in\) well orders $z$ and thus $z$ is an ordinal.


\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.26}{39}
  Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, $z$ is an ordinal iff $z$ is
a transitive set and all elements of $z$ are transitive sets.
\end{lexcopy}

If $z$ is an ordinal, the by definition it is transitive,
its elements are ordinals by Lemma~ I.7.8 thus transitive.

Conversely, we need to show that \(\in\) is well-order on \(\alpha\).
Assume by negation \(\in\) is not a total order.
Let \(x\in z\) be \(\in\)-minimal such that it is non-comparable
with some elemet in $z$.
Let \(y\in z\) be \(\in\)-minimal such that it is non-comparable
with $x$.
Now if \(u\in y\) then \(u\in x\) hence \(y \subseteq x\).
Similarly, if \(u\in x\) then \(u\in y\) hence \(x \subseteq y\),
thus \(x = y\) is a contradiction, and \(\in\) is a total-order on $z$
and by the Axiom of Foundation is well-order. Hence $z$ is an ordinal.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.27}{39}
  Show, in \(BST^{-}\), that if $A$,$B$ are finite,
  then \(A\cup B\) and \(A\times B\)
are finite, and \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) exists and is finite.
\end{lexcopy}
Here without Axiom of Foundation.

By induction on ordinal $n$ for which \(B \preccurlyeq n\).
Let \(B \preccurlyeq n + 1 = \{0, 1, \ldots n - 1\}\).
Pick the (last) element \(b\in B\) that is mapped to \(n-1\),
and let \(B' = B \setminus \{b\}\), so now \(B \preccurlyeq n\).

\(\mathbf{A\cup B}\):
Let \(f'\) be a 1-1 function \(A \cup B' \to n - 1\)
If \(b\in A\) the the same \(f'\) maps  \(A \cup B \to n - 1\),
Otherwise we define \(f: A \cup B \to n\), by
\(f(b) = n - 1\) and \(f(b') = f'(b')\) for \(b'\in B'\).

\(\mathbf{A\times B}\):
Let \(g: A \to m\) be 1-1 mapping, and let \(a_i = g^{-1}(i)\)
for \(0 \leq i < m\).
Let \(f'\) be a 1-1 function \(A \times B' \to M\)
It is easy to have 1-1- map
\(A \times B \to (A \times B') \cup (\{x\} \times B)\),
we can pick any \(x\notin A\) for example \(\{A\}\).
The finiteness is now derived from the previous result.

\(\mathbf{P(A)}\): Similarly we
set the disjoint union \(A = A' \cup \{a\}\).
Given a 1-1 map \(f': P(A') \to m\)
Define
\begin{equation*}
f: P(A) \to (\{0\}\times m) \cup (\{1\}\times m)
\end{equation*}
by:
\begin{equation*}
f(B) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
(\{0\}, f'(B)) & \textrm{if}\; B \subseteq A' \\
(\{1\}, f'(B \setminus \{a\})) & \textrm{if}\; B \not\subseteq A'
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

  Derive the Axioms of Infinity and Replacement from (2) of Lemma I.9.5.
\end{lexcopy}
\textbf{Infinity:} Define $R$ by \(xRy\) iff \(S(x) = y\)
\\
\textbf{Replacement:} Define $R$ by \(xRy\) iff
\(\forall z(\varphi(x, z) \to y = z)\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.8}{46}
  If $R$ is well-founded on $A$, then $R$ is acyclic on $A$; hence, \(R^*\)
  is a strict partial order on $A$.
  Conversely, if $A$ is finite and $R$ is acyclic on $A$,
then $R$ is well-founded on $A$.
\end{lexcopy}
If there was an $R$-cylce there would be no $R$ minimal element in $A$.
The definition of \(R^*\) via $R$-path gives transitivity, namely
\begin{equation*}
\forall x,y,z\,\left(xRy \wedge yRz \;\to\; xRz\right).
\end{equation*}

Conversely, each $R$-path must be finite for there are no cycles
and $A$ is finite. Thus there exists $R$-minimal element
(or \(A=\emptyset\)).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.27}{54}
  Assume that each element of \R\ has rank \(\omega\);
  this will be true
using our Definition 1.14-2. Let \(\mu\) be Lebesgue measure on \R. Prove that
\(\R,\mu \in WF\), with \(\textrm{rank}(\R) = \omega + 1\)
and \(\textrm{rank}(\mu) = \omega + 4\).
\end{lexcopy}
Since the members of each \(x\in \R\) all have rank of \(\omega\),
\begin{equation*}
\rank(\R)=\max(\{\rank(x)+1: x\in\R\|) = \omega+1.
\end{equation*}
Nonempty subsets of \(\R\) have rank of \(\omega+2\).
Rank of pairs where \(a\in\R\) and \(\emptyset \neq A \subset \R\)
\begin{equation*}
\rank(\langle A, a\rangle)
 = \max(\rank(A),\rank(a)) + 2
 = \max(\omega+1,\omega) + 2 = \omega + 3.
\end{equation*}
Now \(\mu\) is a nonempty set cosisting of such pairs,
Thus
\begin{equation*}
\omega + 3 + 1 \leq \rank(\mu)
\leq \rank\left(
  \mathcal{P}(\{\langle A, a\rangle): a\in\R \wedge A\subset\R\}
   \right)
= \omega + 4.
\end{equation*}
So the abpve inequalities are actually equalities.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.39}{59}
Assume that $R$ is well-founded and set-like on $A$. Then
\(\textrm{rank}_{A,R}\) is 1-1 iff \(R^*\) is a total order of $A$.
\end{lexcopy}

Assume \(\textrm{rank}_{A,R}\) is 1-1
and by negation \((x,y),(y,x) \notin R^*\).
Let \(W = \{x,y\}\,\cup\,\{w\in A: (w,x)\in R^*\;\lor\; (w,y)\in R^*\}\).


Let \(E=\{y'\in W: y'\neq x\;\land\; (y',x)\notin R^*\}\neq \emptyset\).
\(y\in E\), so let \(y_0\in E\) be \(R^*\)-minimal.
Similarly, 
let \(F=\{x'\in E: x'\neq y' \;\land\; (x',y')\notin R^*\}\neq \emptyset\)
and let \(x_0\in F\) be \(R^*\)-minimal and \(x_0 \neq y_0\).

Being minimal we now have
\begin{equation*}
\{z\in A: (z,x_0)\in R^*\} = \{z\in A: (z,y_o)\in R^*\}.
\end{equation*}
Hence \(\rank(x_0) = \rank(y_0)\) a contradiction.

Conversely, assume \(\R^*\) is a total order.
Let \(x,y\in A\), \wlogy \((x,y)\in R^*\) thus \(\rank(y)>\rank(x)\).


\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.40}{59}
If \(R_1 \subseteq R_2\) are both well-founded and set-like on $A$, then
\(\rank_{A,R_1}(y) \leq \rank_{A,R_2}(y)\)
for all \(y \in A\). Also, 
\(\rank_{A,R_1}(y) = \rank_{A,R_2}(y)\)
if \(R_1 \subseteq R_2 \subseteq (R_1)^*\).
\end{lexcopy}

By negation assume
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I.9.40:neg}
\rank_{A,R_1}(y) > \rank_{A,R_2}(y).
\end{equation}
By looking at \(\pred_{A,R_2}(y)\) we can assume that $y$ is \(R_2\)-mininal
for \eqref{eq:I.9.40:neg}.
Now we have the contradiction:
\begin{equation*}
\rank_{A,R_1}(y)
= \sup\{\rank_{A,R_1}(x): xR_1y\}
\leq 
  \sup\{\rank_{A,R_2}(x): xR_2y\} = \rank_{A,R_2}(y).
\end{equation*}

We will now show that for any well-founded and set-like $R$ on $A$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I.9.40:ReqRstar}
\rank_{A,R}(x) = \rank_{A,R^*}(x) \quad \forall x\in A.
\end{equation}
By induction define \(R^0=\emptyset\), \(R^1=R\)
and for each \(n<\omega \land n > 1\)
\begin{equation*}
R^n = \left\{\langle x, y \rangle: \exists z, xR^{n-1}z \land zR^{n-1}y\right\}.
\end{equation*}
Clearly \(R^* = \cup_{n<\omega}R^n\), so it will
be sufficient to show by induction that
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:I.9.40:ReqRn}
\rank_{A,R}(x) = \rank_{A,R^n}(x) \quad \forall x\in A.
\end{equation}
Let \(n > 1\).
By previous result we have \(\rank_{A,R^{n-1}}(x) \leq \rank_{A,R^n}(x)\).
By negation assume
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I.9.40:negstar}
\rank_{A,R^{n-1}}(x) < \rank_{A,R^n}(x).
\end{equation}
By considereing \(\pred_{A,R^n}(x)\)
we can assume that $x$ is \(R^n\)-mininal for \eqref{eq:I.9.40:negstar}.
By induction, for each $y$ such that \(yR^{n-1}x\) we have
\(\rank_{A,R^{n-1}}(y) = \rank_{A,R^n}(y)\). Hence there is some $y$
such that \(\langle y, x \rangle \in R^n \setminus R^{n-1}\).
Thus there is in $R$-path of $n$ steps via $s$ function,
where \(s(0)=y\), \(s(k)\,R\,s(k+1)\) and \(s(n)=x\)
Put \(x'=s(n-1)\), so \(\rank_{A,R^{n-1}}(x') < \rank_{A,R^n}(x')\)
Since \(x'Rx\) and $y$ and $s$ are arbitrary \eqref{eq:I.9.40:ReqRn}
and so \eqref{eq:I.9.40:ReqRstar} is proved.

Back to the exercise's last part.  we already shown
\begin{equation*}
\rank_{A,R_1}(y) \leq \rank_{A,R_2}(y) \leq \rank_{A,R_*^*}(y)
\end{equation*}
by \eqref{eq:I.9.40:ReqRn} the last inequalities are actual equalities,
that is \(\rank_{A,R_1}(y) = \rank_{A,R_2}(y)\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.41}{59}
Assume that $R$ is well-founded and set-like on $A$, and that $R$
is a transitive relation on $A$.

\end{lexcopy}

% using:  frederic-wang.fr/mathematics/set-theory/kunen/chapter_1.html
By transitivity \(R=R^*\).
By negation we have \(\mos_{A,R}(a) \neq \rank_{A,R}(a)\)
for some $R$-minimal $a$.
Since \(\mos(\emptyset)=\emptyset=\rank(\emptyset])\)
clearly \(a\neq\emptyset\).
By Lemma~I.7.13 union of ordinals that is a set --- is an ordinal.
By minimally
\begin{equation*}
\mos(a)
= \{\mos(x): xRa\}
= \{\rank(x): xRa\} % = \alpha. % = \beta = \rank(b).
\end{equation*}
and by Lemma~I.9.16
\begin{equation*}
\{\rank(x): xRa\} = \{\alpha: \alpha < \rank(a)\} = \rank(a),

\end{lexcopy}
The proof of Theorem~1.8.2 dedines a map from \(a\in A\)
to a unique oridinal \(\xi\) so \((\xi,\in)\)
is isomorphic with \((a\kern -0.2em\downarrow,R)\).
By Lemma~I.9.17 \(rank_{ON,\in}(\xi) = \xi\)
and since the isomorphism is unique, it is equals to \(\rank\).
By previous exercise is equals to \(\mos\) as well.

let $a$ be \(\in\)-minimal element in \(WF\setminus K\).
Now
\begin{equation*}
a = \{x\in a\} = \{x \in a\cap K\} \subseteq K.

The last equality holds by minimality of $a$.

or \(B \setminus \{a\} \subset A_0\) has $R$-minimal element.

Let $R$ be set-like on $A$, and let \(W = WF_{A,R}\) Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(A\setminus W\) has no $R$-minimal elements.
\item $R$ is well-founded on $W$.
\item For \(a \in W\), \(\rank_{A,R}(a) = \rank_{W,R}(a)\).
\item For \(a\in A\): \(a\in W\) iff \(\pred_{A,R^*}(a) \subseteq W\)
      iff \(\pred_{A,R}(a) \subseteq W\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Using item~2.\ If by negation $a$ is $R$-minimal in \(A \setminus W\)
    then \(P=\pred_{A,R^*}(b) \subset W\).
    Then by following \textbf{2.}, $R$ is well-founded on $P$
    contrdiction to \(a\notin W\).
  
  \item
    Let \(B \subset W\) be non-empty subset.
    Pick some \(b\in B\). Let \(P = \pred_{A,R^*}(b)\) which is well-founded.
    Now $R$ is well-founded on \(B \cap P\) and has a $R$-minimal
    element \(c \in B \cap P)\). But $c$ must also be $R$-minimal in $B$
    since otherwise there exists \(x\in B\) and \(xRc\), and then \(x\in P\)
    contradicting $R$-minimality of $c$ in \(B \cap P)\).
    Hence $W$ is well-founded.

  \item
    For \(a\in W\)
    \begin{align}
      \rank_{A,R}(a) &= \rank_{\{a\}\cup\pred_{A,R^*},R}(a) \nonumber \\
      &= \sup\{\rank_{\pred_{A,R^*},R}(x) + 1: xRa\} \nonumber \\
      &= \sup\{\rank_{W,R}(x) + 1: xRa\} = \rank_{W,R}(a) \label{eq:rank:W}
    \end{align}
    The \eqref{eq:rank:W} equality
    is justified by the fact the the \(\sup\) operator
    recursively runs in both cases on \(\pred_{A,R^*}(a)\).

  \item
    Assume \(a \in W\). Then $R$ is well founded on \(P_a=\pred_{A,R^*}(a)\).
    Clearly for each \(b\in P\)
    \begin{equation*}
      P_b = \pred_{A,R^*}(b) \subset \pred_{A,R^*}(a) = P_a.
    \end{equation*}
    and  $R$ is well founded on \(P_n\) and thus \(b\in W\)
    and so \(P_a\subset W\).

    Assume \(\pred_{A,R^*}(a) \subset W\). Clearly
    \begin{equation*}
      \pred_{A,R}(a) \subset \pred_{A,R^*}(a) \subset W
    \end{equation*}

    Assume \(P_a = \pred_{A,R}(a) \subset W\).
    For each \(b \in P_a\) we have $R$ well founded on\(P_b = \pred_{A,R^*}(b)\).
    \begin{align*}
       \pred_{A,R^*}(a) = \cup_{b\in P_a} \{b\} \cup \pred_{A,R^*}(b) \subset W.

\(\sigma \in \omega^{<\omega}\) (see Definition~1.6.11). The prerequisites for
\framebox{a} are all \framebox{\(\tau\)} such that
\(\tau\) is obtained from \(\tau\) by replacing one term $n$ from
\(\tau\)r by a finite (possibly empty) sequence of numbers less than $n$.
For example,
\framebox{\(2,1,7,1\)} teaches you all about the sequence \((2,1, 7,1)a\),
and has as prerequisites
\framebox{\(1,7,1\)},
\framebox{\(|0,1,1,0,1,7,1\)},
\framebox{\(2,1,5,5,4,0,1,1\)}, etc.
\framebox{\ } teaches you all about the empty sequence \(\emptyset\),
and has no prerequisite. No number is less than $0$, so
the only prerequisite for \framebox{$0$} is \framebox{\ }.

Prove that the prerequisite relation is well-founded; so, you can graduate
in some ordinal number of semesters.
\item

in which you can possibly take course $x$.

\item
 For each sequence \(\tau\) consider its canonical reduction
 \(tau'\) to strictly reducing sequence where for each $n$ in \(tau\),
 $n$ appears exactly once in \(tau\).
 Consider the lexicographic order on the canonical reductions.
 For each subset $S$ sequences, we can find some \(\sigma\in S\) with the minimal
 canonical reduction.
 By considering the first difference in the canonical reductions,
 it is easy to see that \(\sigma\)  has no strict prerequisite in $S$.
\item
Let $R$ be the prerequisite relation.
Let \(z_0 = \emptyset\) and for any natural \(n>1\)
\(z_n = \bigl(\overbrace{0,\ldots,0}^n\bigr)\).
Clearly \(\rank(z_n) = n\).
For any \(\tau\)
having \(m>0\) in its sequence we have \(z_n R \tau\)
and thus \(\rank(\tau)=\omega\).

Let $R$ be well-founded and set-like on $A$. Prove that there is

Following hint. For \(y\in A\)
let \(T(y) = \{\lrangle{0,y},\lrangle{1,y},\lrangle{2,y}\}\)
and let
\begin{equation*}
F(y) = \{F(x): x\in y\kdownarrow\} \cup T(y). %  = \textrm{mos}(y)\cup T(y).
\end{equation*}
% Similar to Mostowsky function which is not necessarily \(1-1\).
If \(xRy\) then by definition \(F(x)\in F(y)\).
Assume \(F(y_1) = F(y_2)\). Then \(z_1 = \lrangle{0,y_1} \in F(y_2)\).
But \(\lrangle{0,y_1}\) has at most two elements,
while \(F(x)\) has at least three.
Hence \(\lrangle{0,y_1} \in T(y_2)\) and by uniqueness of pairs (Lemma~I.4.12)
\(\lrangle{0,y_1} = \lrangle{0,y_2}\) and so \(y_1 = y_2\).
Thus $F$ is 1-1, and with \(M=F(A)\) we have isomorphism.

    s \;\textnormal{is a function and}\, \dom(s)=x\kdownarrow \\

\end{equation*}
If by negation there exists $F$ such that
\(F(x) = G(x,F\vert x\kdownarrow)\).
Union of ordinals is an orfinal and so is \(F(x)\).
If \(xRy\) then
\begin{equation*}
F(x) < F(x) + 1 = \widehat{S}(x) \leq F(y).
\end{equation*}
By Lemma~I.9.9, $R$ is well-founded, a contradiction.

Using Definition~I.9.28 \(R(\alpha) = \{x \in WF : \rank(x) < \alpha\}\)
Assume by negation $X$ has no $R$-minimal element.
For each (set!) \(x\in X\) let
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \min\{\rank(z) : z \in X \wedge zRx\}
\end{equation*}
Clearly \(f(x)\) are ordinals. Pick \(x_0 \in X\) and let
\(\gamma_0 = \rank(x_9) + 1\). By induction define for any natural \(n\in\omega\)
\begin{equation*}
\gamma_{n+1} = \sup\left(\{f⁢(x): x \in X\cap R⁢(\gamma_n)\} \cup
  \{\gamma_n + 1\}\right).
\end{equation*}
Let \(\gamma = \sup_{n\in\omega} \gamma_n\). Now
\begin{equation*}
x_0 \in X\cap R⁢(\gamma_0) \subseteq X\cap R⁢(\gamma).
\end{equation*}
and \(\rank⁡(x) < \gamma\) for all \(x\in X\cap R⁢(\gamma)\).
% So there is \(n<\omega\) such that \(\rank(x) < \gamma_n\).
% Then \(f⁢(x) \leq \gamma_n + 1 < \gamma\).

Now, let \(x_1\) be a $R$-minimal element of the set \(X\cap R⁢(\gamma)\).
By the definition of $f$, 
let \(z\in X\) be such that \(z⁢R⁢x_1\) and \(\rank⁡(z)=f⁢(x_1)\).
Then \(\rank⁡(z) < \gamma\) and so actually \(z \in X\cap R⁢(\gamma)\).
This contradicts the minimality of \(x_1\).

\(\alpha^{\gamma}=\sup_{\beta<\gamma}\alpha^\beta\) for \(\gamma\) a limit.

We need to show

\(\alpha^{(\beta\gamma)} = (\alpha^\beta)^\gamma\).

By negation, let \(\gamma\) be the minimal ordinal for which
\begin{equation} \label{eq:apbg:neq}
\alpha^{\beta+\gamma} \neq  \alpha^\beta \cdot \alpha^\gamma.

If \(\gamma\) is a successor, then we have \(\gamma'+1=\gamma\)
then
\begin{equation*}
\alpha^{\beta+\gamma}

= \alpha^{\beta+\gamma'}\cdot\alpha

= \alpha^\beta\cdot\left(\alpha^{\gamma'}\right)\cdot\alpha
= \alpha^\beta\cdot\alpha^{\gamma'+1}
= \alpha^\beta\cdot\alpha^\gamma.
\end{equation*}
Otherwise \(\gamma\) is a successor,
and we have \(\gamma = \sup\{\mu: \mu<\gamma\}\) and then
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{\beta+\gamma}
&= \alpha^{\beta+(\sup_{\mu<\gamma}\mu)}
= \alpha^{\sup_{\mu<\gamma}(\beta+\mu)}
= \alpha^{\sup_{\mu<\gamma}(\beta+\mu)} \\
&= \sup_{\mu<\gamma}\alpha^{\beta+\mu}
= \sup_{\mu<\gamma}\alpha^\beta\cdot\alpha^\mu
= \alpha^\beta\cdot\sup_{\mu<\gamma}\alpha^\mu
= \alpha^\beta\cdot\alpha^\gamma.
\end{align*}
and both cases contradict \eqref{eq:apbg:neq}.

By negation, let \(\gamma\) be the minimal ordinal for which
\begin{equation} \label{eq:apbpg:neq}
\alpha^{\beta\cdot\gamma} \neq  \left(\alpha^\beta\right)^\gamma.
\end{equation}
If \(\gamma\) is a successor, then we have \(\gamma'+1=\gamma\)
then
\begin{equation*}
\alpha^{(\beta\cdot\gamma)}

Otherwise \(\gamma\) is a successor,

\begin{equation*}
\alpha^{(\beta\cdot\gamma)}

Let \Fab\ be the set of all functions $f$ from

that \(\{\xi < \beta: f(\xi) \neq 0\}\) finite.
For \(f,g \in \Fab\) with \(f \neq g\), define \(f \triangleleft g\)
iff \(f(\xi) < g(\xi)\), where \(\xi\) is the largest ordinal such
that \(f(\xi) \neq g(\xi)\). Prove that
\(\triangleleft\) well-orders \Fab\ in type \(\alpha^\beta\).
\end{lexcopy}

Associativity:\\
Let \(f_1 \triangleleft F_2 \triangleleft f_2\).
For \(j=1,2\) let \(\xi_j\) be the maximal such that
\(f_j(\xi_j) \neq f_{j+1}(\xi_j)\) and
assume \mbox{\(f_j(\xi_j) < f_{j+1}(\xi_j)\)}.
Let \(\xi_3\) be maximal such that \(f_1(\xi_3) \neq f_3(\xi_3)\).
For all \(x>\max(\xi_1,\xi_2)\) we have \(f_1(x)=f_2(x)=f_3(x)\).
Hence \(\xi_3 \leq \max(\xi_1,\xi_2)\).

Let's examine cases:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c p{0.6\textwidth}}\\
\textbf{Case} & & \textbf{Implies} \\
\(\xi_1 < \xi_2\) & \(\quad\rightarrow\) & 
  \(\xi_3=\xi_2 \;\land\; f_1(\xi_3)=f_2(\xi_3)<f_3(\xi_3)\)\\
\(\xi_1 > \xi_2\) & \(\quad\rightarrow\) & 
  \(\xi_3=\xi_1 \;\land\; f_1(\xi_3)<f_2(\xi_3)=f_3(\xi_3)\)\\
\(\xi_1 = \xi_2\) & \(\quad\rightarrow\) & 
  \(\xi_3=\xi_1=\xi_2\;\land\; f_1(\xi_3)<f_2(\xi_3)<f_3(\xi_3)\)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Hence \(\triangleleft\) is an order.

Let \(\emptyset\neq X \subseteq \Fab\).
Denote the constant zero function \(\zeta\in \Fab\), \(\zeta(x)=0\)
for all \(x\in\beta\). If \(\zeta \in X\) then \(\zeta\) is a mininal.
Otherwise,
for each \(f\in X\) let \(\gamma_f=\max\{x\in \beta: f(x)\neq 0\}\).
Let \(\xi = \min\{\gamma_f: f\in X\}\).
Let \(Y = \{f(\xi): \gamma_f = \xi\) and
let \(y = \min(Y)\). Now pick some \(f\in \Fab\)
such that \(f(\xi)=y\). Note that \(f(x)=0\) for all \(x>\xi\).
Clearly $f$ is mininal in $X$.
Thus \(\triangleleft\) well orders \Fab.

We now show \(\type(\Fab) = \alpha^\beta\) following \cite{WangFrederic}
by induction on \(\beta\).

If \(\beta=\emptyset\) then \(\alpha^\beta=\{\emptyset\}\)
and \(\type(\alpha^\emptyset)=1=\type(\{\emptyset\})\).

\newcommand*{\Faet}{\ensuremath{F(\alpha, \eta)}}
\newcommand*{\Fag}{\ensuremath{F(\alpha, \gamma)}}
If \(\beta=\eta+1\) is a successor, then
let \(G_\xi = \{f\in\Fab:f(\eta)=\xi\}\) for \(\xi<\alpha\), now
\begin{equation*}
\Fab \sim G_0 + G_1 + \cdots = \sum_{\xi<\alpha} G_\xi.
\end{equation*}
Each \(G_\xi \simeq \Faet\). Thus
\begin{equation*}
\type(\Fab) = \type\left(\overbrace{G_0 + G_1 + \cdots}^\alpha\right)
  = \type\left(\sum_{\xi<\alpha} G_\xi\right)
  = \type(\Faet\cdot\alpha)
  = \alpha^{\eta+1} = \alpha^\beta.
\end{equation*}

Assume \(\beta\) is a limit ordinal.
For all \(\gamma < \beta\) let
\begin{equation*}
X_\gamma = \{f\in\Fab: \forall \xi\geq\gamma\; f(\xi)=0\}.
\end{equation*}
Each \(X_\gamma\) is an initial segment of \Fab\ isomorphic
to \Fag\ and by induction to \(\alpha^\gamma\).
ׁHence \(\alpha^{\gamma}\leq \type(\Fag)\).
Since this holds for all \(\gamma < \beta\) we have
\(\alpha^\beta \leq \type(\Fab)\).
Assume by negation \(\alpha^\beta < \type(\Fab)\)
and let \(g\in\Fab\) be a function such that the initial segment
\(\{f\in\Fab:f\triangleleft g\}\) is isomorphic to \(\alpha^\beta\).
Let \(\xi<\beta\) be the largest element such that
\(g⁢(\xi)\neq 0\) and let \(\gamma=\xi+1\).
Let \(f=\chi_{\{\gamma\}} \in \Fab\).
The inital segment of $f$ is the set \(X_\gamma\) for which
\(\type(X_\gamma) = \alpha^\gamma < \alpha^\beta\)
and so \(f\triangleleft g\) by definition of $g$.
But by construction of $f$ we also have \(g\triangleleft f\), a contradiction.
Hence \(\type(\Fab) = \alpha^\beta\).

\end{lexcopy}

Using \cite{WangFrederic}.

Put \(\gamma(\alpha) = \type(\alpha \times \alpha, \triangleleft)\).
The ordering on \((\alpha+1)\times(\alpha+1)\) is ordered as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\type(\alpha, \alpha, \triangleleft)
\quad,\quad \{(\xi,\alpha): 0\leq\xi<\alpha\}
\quad,\quad \{(\alpha,\xi): 0\leq\xi\leq\alpha\}
\end{equation*}
So for all \(\alpha\),
\(\gamma(\alpha+1) = \gamma(\alpha) + \alpha\times 2 + 1\).
If \(\alpha \geq 1\) then \(\alpha\cdot ⁢2+1 > \alpha+1\).
Hence any successor ordinal \(\alpha \geq 2\)
is not a fixed point of \(\gamma\).
We note that if $n$ is a finite ordinal then \(|n\times n| = n^2\)
so \(\gamma⁢(n) = n^2\).
In particular, \(n=0\) and \(n=1\) are fixed points of \(\gamma\)
and moreover \(\gamma⁢(\omega) = \sup_{n<\omega⁡}\gamma⁢(n) = \omega\).

By induction on \(n < \omega\), it’s easy to generalize the induction relation
for \(\gamma⁢(\alpha+1)\) by
\begin{equation*}
\forall \alpha \geq \omega, \gamma⁢(\alpha+n)=\gamma⁢(\alpha)+\alpha⋅2⁢n+n
\end{equation*}
and so
\begin{equation*}
\gamma⁢(\alpha + \omega) = \sup_{n<\omega⁡}\gamma⁢(\alpha + n) =
\gamma⁢(\alpha) + \alpha⋅\omega.
\end{equation*}
If \(\alpha \geq \omega\) and
\(\omega^{\beta_1}⁢ n_1 + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_k}⁢ n_k\)
its Cantor
Normal Form, then for all \(n < \omega\)
we have
\begin{equation*}
\alpha \cdot n =
 \omega^{\beta_1⁢}\cdot (n_1\cdot⁢ n) + \omega^{\beta_2}⁢\cdot n_2 + \cdots +
   \omega^{\beta_k}⁢\cdot n_k
\end{equation*}
and
so
\begin{equation*}
\alpha \cdot \omega = \sup_{n<\omega}⁡\omega^{\beta_1} \cdot n = \omega^{\beta_1 + 1}.
\end{equation*}
Finally,
\begin{equation*}
\gamma⁢(\alpha + \omega)=\gamma⁢(\alpha) + \omega^{\log_\omega⁡(\alpha) + 1}.
\end{equation*}

We generalize the previous expression: for any \(\alpha \geq \omega\)
and \(\beta \geq 1\) such that \(\log_\omega⁡(\alpha) + 1 \geq \beta\)
we have
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\alpha+\omega^{\beta})=\gamma(\alpha)+\omega^{\log_{\omega}(\alpha)+\beta}.
\end{equation*}
We prove by induction on \(\beta\)
that for all such \(\alpha\) the expression is true. We just
verified \(\beta =1\) and the limit case is obvious by continuity
of \(\gamma\) and of the sum/exponentiation in the second variable. For
the successor step, if \(\log_\omega⁡(\alpha) + 1 \geq \beta + 1\) then a
fortiori
\begin{equation*}
\forall_{1\leq n<\omega} \log_\omega⁡(\alpha + \omega^\beta \cdot n) + 1
  \geq \beta + 1 \geq \beta.
\end{equation*}
We can then use the induction hypothesis
to prove by induction on \(1\leq n<\omega\) that
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\alpha+{\omega^{\beta}\cdot n})
  = \gamma(\alpha)+\omega^{\log_{\omega}(\alpha)+\beta}\cdot n.
\end{equation*}
For \(n=1\), this is just the induction hypothesis
of \(\beta\) (for the same \(\alpha\)!). For the successor step, we need to
use the induction hypothesis of \(\beta\)
(for \(\alpha + \omega^\beta \cdot n)\)
which is
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\alpha+{\omega^{\beta}\cdot{(n+1)}})
  = \gamma(\alpha+{\omega^{\beta} \cdot n})
     + \omega^{\log_{\omega}(\alpha)+\beta}.
\end{equation*}
Finally,
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\alpha + \omega^{\beta+1})
  = {\sup_{1\leq n< \omega}{\gamma(\alpha+{\omega^{\beta}\cdot n})}}
  = \gamma(\alpha)+\omega^{\log_{\omega}(\alpha)+\beta+1}.
\end{equation*}
as wanted.

If \(\alpha\) is a limit ordinal and
\begin{equation*}
\omega^{\beta_1}n_1 + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_{k}}n_k
\end{equation*}
its Cantor Normal Form, then from the previous relation we deduce
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\alpha)
 = \gamma\left(\omega^{\beta_1}\right)
   + \omega^{\beta_1\cdot 2}
     \left(n_1-1\right)
     + \omega^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}}\cdot n_{2} + \cdots
     + \omega^{\beta_{1}+\beta_{k}}\cdot n_{k}
\end{equation*}
In particular, \(\gamma(\alpha) > \alpha\)
or \(n1 \geq 2\). For all \(\alpha \geq 1\),
\(\log_{\omega}(\omega^\alpha)+1 = \alpha + 1\)
so the previous paragraph also gives
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+1})
 = \gamma\left(\omega^{\alpha} + \omega^{\alpha+1}\right)
 = \gamma(\omega^{\alpha}) + \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2+1}
\end{equation*}
In particular,
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+1}) \geq \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + 1} > \omega^{\alpha+1}.
\end{equation*}
Moreover, by
induction on \(n < \omega\), we can show that
\(\gamma(\omega^{n+1})=\omega^{2n+1}\)
and so
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\omega})
 = \sup_{1\leq n < \omega}\gamma\left({\omega^n}\right)
 = \omega^{\omega}
\end{equation*}

We try to generalize the relation on
\(\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+1})\)
as follows. For any \(\alpha, \beta \geq 1\) such that
\(\log_{\omega}(\alpha) > \log_{\omega}(\beta)\)
we have
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+\beta})
  = \gamma(\omega^{\alpha}) + \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta}.
\end{equation*}
This is done by induction on \(\beta < \alpha\) for a fixed \(\alpha\).
We already verified the case \(\beta = 1\) in
the previous paragraph and the limit case is obvious by continuity
of \(\gamma\) and of the sum/exponentiation in the second variable.
For the successor step, we have
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+\beta + 1})
  = {\gamma(\omega^{\alpha + \beta})} + \omega^{{(\alpha + \beta)}\cdot 2 + 1}
\end{equation*}
and by induction hypothesis,
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\alpha+\beta})
  = \gamma(\omega^{\alpha}) + \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta}.
\end{equation*}
Since
\begin{equation*}
\log_{\omega}(\alpha) > \log_{\omega}(\beta + 1) = \log_{\omega}(\beta)
\end{equation*}
we have
\begin{equation*}
(\alpha+\beta)\cdot 2 + 1
  = \alpha+\beta + \alpha+\beta + 1 = \alpha\cdot 2 + \beta + 1 >
  \alpha\cdot 2 + \beta
\end{equation*}
and so
\begin{equation*}
\omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta} + \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta + 1}
  = \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta + 1}
\end{equation*}
Finally,
\begin{equation*}
{\gamma(\omega^{\alpha + \beta + 1})}
  = {\gamma(\omega^{\alpha + \beta})} + \omega^{\alpha\cdot 2 + \beta + 1}
\end{equation*}
as wanted.

For any \(1\leq n<\omega\) and \(\alpha \geq 1\),
if \(1\leq \beta < \omega\alpha\)
then
\begin{equation*}
\log_{\omega}(\beta) < \alpha = \log_{\omega}(\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n).
\end{equation*}
Hence the relation of the previous paragraph
gives
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n} + \beta})
  = \gamma(\omega^{{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n}}) + \omega^{{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot{2n}} + \beta}.
\end{equation*}
Then by continuity of \(\gamma\) and of the sum/exponentiation
in the second variable, we can consider the limit
\(\beta \rightarrow \omega^{\alpha}\).
This gives
\begin{equation*}
{\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot(n + 1)})}
  ={\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n})} + \omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot{(2n + 1)}}.
\end{equation*}
By induction, we deduce on \(2\leq n < \omega\) we deduce
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n})
  = \gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}}) + \omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot{(2n-1)}}
\end{equation*}
and in particular
\begin{equation*}
\forall 2\leq n < \omega,\,
 \gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n}) > \omega^{\omega^{\alpha}\cdot n}.
\end{equation*}
We can also consider the limit \(n \rightarrow \omega\) and we obtain
\begin{equation*}
{\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha + 1}})}
 = {\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}})} + \omega^{\omega^{\alpha+1}}.
\end{equation*}


To conclude, we have found the following fixed points of
\(\gamma\): \(0, 1, \omega, \omega^\omega\)
and in general we saw that infinite fixed
points can only be of the form
\(\omega^{\omega^\alpha}\).
But we can prove
that these are indeed fixed points by induction on
\(\alpha \geq 1\).
For \(\alpha = 1\), this is \(\omega^\omega\) and the limit case is obvious by
continuity of \(\gamma\) and of the exponentiation in the second
variable. For the successor case, we use the formula obtained in the
previous paragraph:
\begin{equation*}
{\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha + 1}})}
  = {\gamma(\omega^{\omega^{\alpha}})} + \omega^{\omega^{\alpha + 1}}
  = \omega^{\omega^{\alpha}} + \omega^{\omega^{\alpha + 1}}
  =\omega^{\omega^{\alpha + 1}}.
\end{equation*}

Applying transfinite recursion, define \(\delta_\xi\) by:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{lll}
\mpointhand & \delta_0 = 0. &
    \mpointhand \qquad \delta_{\xi + 1} = \aleph_{\delta_\xi} \\
\mpointhand & \delta_\eta = \sup\{\delta_\xi: \xi < \eta\} &
  \textit{when}\; \eta\ \textit{is a limit ordinal}. \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
Show that \(\aleph_{\delta_\eta} = \delta_\eta\) for all limit \(\eta\).
\end{lexcopy}

Assume \(\eta\) is a limit ordinal, Then
\(\xi < \eta \; \leftrightarrow \; \xi + 1 < \eta\). Now
\begin{align*}
\aleph_{\delta_\eta}
  &= \aleph_{\delta_{\sup\{\xi < \eta\}}} \\
  &= \aleph_{\delta_{\sup\{\xi + 1 < \eta\}}}
\end{align*}
