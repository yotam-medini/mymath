Write a formula expressing 
 \(z = \lrangle{\lrangle{x,y},\lrangle{v,w}}\)
using just \(\in\) and \(=\).

\begin{excopy}
Show that \(\alpha < \beta\) implies that 
\(\gamma + \alpha < \gamma + \beta\) 
and
\(\alpha + \gamma \leq \beta + \gamma\).
Give an example to show that the \(\leq\)
cannot be replaced by $<$.
Also show:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha < \beta \ra \exists! \delta (\alpha + \delta = \beta).
\end{equation*}
\end{excopy}

Following Definition~7.17
\begin{equation*}
\gamma\times\{0\} \cup \alpha\times\{1\}
\subsetneq
\gamma\times\{0\} \cup \beta\times\{1\}.\
\end{equation*}
and the corresponding relations
\(R_{\gamma+\alpha} \subsetneq R_{\gamma+\beta}\).
By Theorem~6.3, the unique identity isomorphism of 
\(\gamma+\alpha\) to itself as a proper subset gives 
\(\gamma + \alpha < \gamma + \beta\),

By negation, \(\beta + \gamma < \alpha + \gamma\).
Consider the injectin isomorphism from 
\(\beta\times\{0\} \cup \gamma\times\{1\}\)
into a proper subset of 
\(\alpha\times\{0\} \cup \gamma\times\{1\}\).

The \(\leq\) is needed for \(0+\omega = 1+\omega\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.4.18}{24}
Derive \(\forall y[y \notin y]\) from the Axioms of Comprehension and
Foundation. Don't use the Pairing or Extensionality Axioms. Then find a
two element model for Foundation, Extensionality, Pairing, and Union, plus
\(\exists y\forall x [x \in y]\) (so, of course, \(y \in y\)).
\end{lexcopy}

By negation \(y\in y\).
By Comprehension, let \(\varphi(z)\) be \(z=y\). Apply
\begin{equation*}
  \exists x \forall z (z \in x \wedge \varphi(z))
\end{equation*}
gives \(x:=\{y\}\). By Foundation, $y$ being the (only) minimal
element for which
\mbox{\(\lnot\exists z(z\in y \wedge z \in \{y\})\)}
should hold, but \(z=y\) gives contradiction.

Let the model have two ``sets'': \(\mu\), \(\nu\).
with the following ``\(\in\)'' relations:
\(\mu\in\nu\), \(\nu\in\nu\).

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.23}{31}
Define the relation $R$ on \(\N \times \N\) by saying: \((x_0,x_1)R(y_0,y_1)\)
iff \(x_0 \leq y_0\) and \(x_1 \leq y_1\)
and \((x_0,x_1)\neq (y_0,y_1)\).
Show that $R$ is well-founded
on \N\ but not a total order.
Show that every non-empty \(X \subseteq \N\times\N\) contains
only finitely many $R$-minimal elements, and, for each \(k \in\N\),
there is such an
$X$ with exactly $k$ $R$-minimal elements.
\end{lexcopy}

Let non-empty \(A \subset \N\times\N\).
Let \(P = \{n\in\N: \exists m((n,m)\in A\).
For each \(n\in P\) let \(Q_n = \{m\in\N: (n,m)\in A\}\).
Let \(p = \min(P)\) and \(q = \min(Q_p)\).
Clearly \((p,q)\in A\) is minimal in $A$.

Not total order since
\((0,1)\not{R}(1,0)\) and
\((1,0)\not{R}(0,1)\).

Given $k$, \(A=\{(n,k-n-1)\in\N\times\N: 0\leq n < k\}\)
has $k$ elements all of which are minimal.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.26}{31}
Show that \(\in\) is a well-order of $3$.
\end{lexcopy}

The set 
\(3 = \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}, \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}\).
has $3$ elements. Clearly for any two elements \(x,y\in 3\)
we have \(x=y \lor (x\in y \lor y \in x)\).
and any non empty subset has a minimal element.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.6.29}{33}
Show that the Axiom of Foundation implies that the successor
function $S$ is $1-1$ on $V$.
\end{lexcopy}
Assume \(x \neq y\). % , \wlogy\ \(b\in x \setminus y\).
If by negation \(S(x) = S(y)\), then % \(b = \{y\}\).
\(x \in S(y)\) and so \(x\in y\).
Similarly \(y \in x\). Thus \(\{x, y\}\) has no ``minimal''
element contradiction to to the Axiom of Foundation.

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.2}{34}
Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, show that every 
nonempty transitive set contains $0$ and show that every non-singleton
transitive
set contains $1$. Then show that $1$ is the only one-element transitive set,
and $2$
is the only two-element transitive set.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.25}{38}
  Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, $z$ is an ordinal iff $z$ is
  a transitive set and \(\in\) satisfies trichotomy on $z$.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.26}{39}
  Assuming the Axiom of Foundation, $z$ is an ordinal iff $z$ is
a transitive set and all elements of $z$ are transitive sets.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.7.27}{39}
  Show, in \(BST^{~}\), that if $A$,$B$ are finite,
  then \(A\cup B\) and \(A\times B\)
are finite, and \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) exists and is finite.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.6}{46}
  Derive the Axioms of Infinity and Replacement from (2) of Lemma I.9.5.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.8}{46}
  If $R$ is well-founded on $A$, then $R$ is acyclic on $A$; hence, \(R^*\)
  is a strict partial order on $A$.
  Conversely, if $A$ is finite and $R$ is acyclic on $A$,
then $R$ is well-founded on $A$.
\end{lexcopy}

\begin{lexcopy}{I.9.27}{54}
  Assume that each element of \R\ has rank \(\omega\);
  this will be true
using our Definition 1.14-2. Let \(\mu\) be Lebesgue measure on \R. Prove that
\(\R,\mu \in WF\), with \(\textrm{rank}(\R) = \omega + 1\)
and \(\textrm{rank}(\mu) = \omega + 4\).
\end{lexcopy}
