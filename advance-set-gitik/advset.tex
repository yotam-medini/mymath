\section{2025/March/23}

In this course we will deal with infinite combinatorics.

Text book for the course:
  \B{Kunen} / \textit{Set SET THEORY, 
    An Introduction to Independence Proofs}

We will use strengthening of the continuum-hypothesis
and strengthening of negation of the continuum-hypothesis.

\subsection{Almost Disjoint Sets}

\begin{ldef}
Let \(\kappa\) be infinite cardinal, \(\scrA \subseteq P(\kappa\)
is a family of of \emph{almost disjoint sets} iff 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any \(A\in \scrA\), \(|A|=\kappa\).
\item For any \(A,B \in scrA\) if \(A\neq B\) then \(|A \cap B|<\kappa\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{ldef}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Maximal Families of Almost Disjoint Sets}

\begin{claim}
Let \(\kappa \geq \aleph_0\) be a regular cardinal.
Let \(\calA \subset P(\kappa)\) be a family of almost disjoint sets.
Then:
\begin{itemize}
\itemch{a} If \(|A|=\kappa\) then \calA\ is not maximal,
that is there exists \(d\leq \kappa\) and for any \(a\in \calA\),
\(d\cap a| < \kappa\).
\itemch{b} There exists a maximal family \(\calB \supset \calA\)
of almost disjoint sets, \(|B| \geq \kappa^+\).
\end{itemize}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
\ich{a} \(\implies\) \ich{b} by the Zorn lemma.

Prooving \ich{a}. Let \(\calA = \{A_\alpha | \alpha < \kappa\}\).
We will ``convert'' it to be ``disjoint''. We will define a family
\(\{A_\alpha'|\alpha < \kappa\}\) of disjoint sets.
\begin{align*}
 A_0' &= A_0 \\
 A_1' &= A_1 \setminus A_0 \\
 A_\alpha' &= A_\alpha \setminus 
   \mathsmaller{\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}} (A_\alpha \setminus A_\beta).
\end{align*}
We get completely disjoint sets.

Define \(B=\{b_\alpha| \alpha<\kappa\}\) where \(b_\alpha \in A_\alpha'\).
\\
\vspace{-12pt}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\(A_0'\) & \(A_1'\) & \(\cdots\) & \(A_\alpha'\) \\
\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\(\in\)} &
\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\(\in\)} &
\(\cdots\) &
\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{\(\in\)} \\
\(b_0\) & \(b_1\) & \(\cdots\) & \(b_\alpha\)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Therefore \(|A_\alpha \cap B| < \kappa\).
\end{proof}

How can we get maximal cardinal?\\
In \(\omega\) such family would have \(2^{\aleph_0}\) cardinality.
We can generalize.

\begin{claim}
Let \(\kappa \geq \aleph_0\) infinite cardinal.

\B{Assumption}: for each \(\alpha < \kappa\), \(2^\alpha \leq \kappa\).
\begin{equation*}
2^{>\kappa} = \mathsmaller{\bigcup_{\alpha < \kappa}}2^\alpha.
\end{equation*}
\(\implies 2^{<\kappa} = \kappa\).
This assumption is kind of the continuum-hypothesis.

There exists \(\calA \subset P(\kappa)\) a family of almost disjoint sets
with maximal cardinality \(2^\kappa\).
\end{claim}
Here we do not assume regularity of \(\kappa\)
\begin{proof}
(With a nice trick.)
Let
\begin{equation*}
I = \{X \subseteq \kappa | \exists \alpha < \kappa, \alpha \supseteq X\}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore \(|I| = \kappa\).
Now argument of \(\leq\) and \(\geq\).
For each \(y \supseteq \kappa\) let
\begin{equation*}
A_y = \{y \cap \alpha | \alpha < \kappa\} \subset I.
\end{equation*}
Assume \(y_1,y_2 \subset \kappa\), \(y_1 \neq y_2\).
So 
\begin{equation*}
 |A_{y_1} \cap A_{y_2}| < \kappa.
\end{equation*}
\emph{Note:} A difference in one element implies a cardinality difference.
Assume \(\delta \in y_1 \setminus y_2\). Then for each \(\alpha\)
such that \(\delta < \alpha < \kappa\) then
\begin{equation*}
 \delta \in y_1\cap \alpha \neq y_2 \cap \alpha
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
Thus we got a maximal family of disjoint sets.

\subsection{Topological Spaces}

\begin{ldef}
A topological space \(\lrangle{X, \tau}\) is \B{separable}
iff there exists \(D\subset X\) countable and dense.
\end{ldef}

\begin{ldef}
A topological space \(\lrangle{X, \tau}\) is called \B{c.c.c.} 
(Countable Chain Condition) iff there are no more than \(\aleph_0\)
disjoint open sets.
\end{ldef}

Separability implies c.c.c. But the opposite direction depends
on conjectures.

Using Tychonoff product:
\begin{itemize}
\item Product of c.c.c spaces is c.c.c.
\item Product of separable spces is not necessarily separable.
\end{itemize}
